# Valentine's Day Card

A cute Valentine's Day card website I created for my girlfriend in 2024. This repository is designed to showcase my mini personal project, featuring the non-deployment code. This version of the project excludes certain operational elements required for a live website, such as server-side configurations and what-not for privacy and security. 

I primarily used JavaScript for the animations, music, confetti effects, Polaroid picture interactions, and the password-protected note (note: this file has been removed for the purpose of this public repository).

I also had registered a domain with her full name as a part of her gift but took it down for privacy reasons. However, you can still check out the project here: [https://myvalentine88.netlify.app/](https://myvalentine88.netlify.app/)

Cheers to doing slightly above the bare minimum for the people we care about (she loved her card) ‚ù§Ô∏èü•Çüéâ
