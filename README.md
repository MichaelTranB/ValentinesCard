# Valentine's Day Card

Valentine's Day card website I created for my gf. 

Used mostly JavaScript for the animations, music, confetti effects, Polaroid picture interactions, and the password-protected note (this file has been removed for the purpose of this public repo).

Also registered a domain with her full name as part of her card but took it down for privacy reasons. You can still check out the project here: [https://myvalentine88.netlify.app/](https://myvalentine88.netlify.app/)
